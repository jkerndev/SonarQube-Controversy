# SonarQube-Controversy
Utilizes machine learning to predict the "controversy" level of a SonarQube rule based on SonarCommunity forum posts.

This repo is a part of an end-of-semester project done for a Cybersecurity Data Science class.

Includes:
- Web scraper for blog posts and rules
- Model creation (Jupyter notebook is in the best state; other ones were for testing)
